This is my personal, lazy github script.

Commands:
	--input = It will put you in to input mode where you can specify
	the directories you want this to check. After you are done you
	will have a file in your home directory called .gitdirs

	--help = Will display this help

_EOF_

}

all() {
	if [ -e "$HOME/.gitdirs" ]; then
	cat .gitdirs | while read line; do echo -e "\n$line";cd $line; git status; cd; done 2>/dev/null
	leave
else
	error
	leave
	fi
}

error() {
	echo "Error! You don't have the file setup. Use --input"
	leave
}


leave() {
	exit
}

if [ "$1" == "--input" ]; then
	echo "Exit by pressing Ctrl+D"
	cat > .gitdirs
	leave

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
